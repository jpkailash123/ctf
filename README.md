I have made a home page for CEG ,having a login button and an navigation bar consisting of a single button which on clicking will have
information about life at CEG.It is positioned at the top-right.The login button doesn't contains any data ,this just opens up another 
tab.I have hosted in the web using a software called File Zilla and buying the domain at Awardspace.The website works perfectly in laptops 
or computers,but when viewed in mobiles or taps the configuration is being altered as i have no idea on responsive web design so i haven't
applied that to my css code.
